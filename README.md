Hello y'all. Welcome to my GitHub portfolio!! <br>
My name is <b>Yosef Pineda</b>, and I am currently pursuing my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at Arizona State University. 

As a recent Computer Science graduate from Arizona State University with a focus on Software Engineering, I have cultivated a good foundation in React.js, JavaScript, and Amazon Web Services (AWS). My academic journey has been complemented by hands-on industry experience in software development, logistics, and process control, reinforcing my technical expertise and problem-solving abilities.
